Hi! I am Harshita, an Electronics and Communication undergraduate at National Institute of Technology Hamirpur.
As a metaverse fanatic, I like experimenting with AR/VR/MR/XR technologies to create immersive experiences and I enjoy exploring UI/UX design, graphic design and game development ðŸŽ®.
Being a member of SPEC-NITH, I advocate for creation of community spaces that foster positive interaction and holistic development.
Apart from that, I spend my time reading fiction, writing content that could be technical or fictitious in nature as well as racking my neurons to solve cryptic crosswords. ðŸ”–
