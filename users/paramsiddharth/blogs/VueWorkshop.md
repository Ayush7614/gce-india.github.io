In a live workshop on YouTube, [Raheel Siddiqui](https://github.com/rawheel), the campus expert from UIT, talked about Vue and how a beginner can get started with it.

We explored:
- What is Vue?
- How is Vue growing so fast?
- Why should you adopt Vue (Vue vs React)?
- Basic concepts of Vue
- Creating your first Vue project
- Understanding of architecture
- Live project coding example

This workshop motivated us to explore Vue as a wonderful front-end web framework (and hopefully Nuxt in future too) by watching Raheel, who has worked with Vue for a long time and is one of the most experienced Vue developers I can think of approaching.

It was a lovely tutorial on Vue. We also have a workshop on React coming up, which will help them further.
