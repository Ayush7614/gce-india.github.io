[Harshita Jain](https://github.com/harshitajain165), the campus expert from NITH, performed live on Spark AR with a workshop at our local community at JUET.

We explored:
- Introduction to AR/VR/MR/XR
- Applications of these budding technologies
- Getting familiar with the Spark AR interface
- Creating a face tracking effect
- Working with the patch editor
- Previewing and testing effects

We have a really active AR/VR/MR/XR community in JUET, and students love exploring Unity 3D for developing AR-related applications. Harshita has a lot of experience developing filters in Spark AR, and gave us a tutorial on how we can do the same ourselves.

The stream had amazing participation from students of both communities and we had a lot of knowledge-sharing among each-other.

By the end, students were enthusiastic about creating effects on their own using Spark AR. We explored the patch editor (similar to that in Blender) and how we can add interactivity to assets and models, and track them using the face tracker.
