Induja is an undergrad student pursuing Computer Science and Business Systems at Chennai Institute of Technology. Her passion towards tech stems from her craving for intellectual stimulation. She prefers to be a generalist in tech and wishes to impact the lives of others through software engineering. Induja is into cross-platform dev, cloud and functional programming at the moment.

Additionally, Induja is a [Google TalentSprint Women Engineers Program Scholar](https://we.talentsprint.com/) (previously known as Google Women Techmakers Engineering Fellowship). She is also part of the Management Team at the Google Developer Student Club on her campus.

Being a strong advocate for diversity and inclusion in tech, Induja volunteers as an [#IamRemarkable](https://iamremarkable.withgoogle.com/) Facilitator, empowering students to practice self-advocacy.

Collaborative learning and inclusion are two values Induja holds high, and that's what draws her to get involved in communities.

Other fun stuff Induja loves: dogs, being a weeb, a great debate
