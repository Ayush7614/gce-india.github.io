I am currently a pre-final undergraduate at IIT KGP pursuing a major in Computer Science Engineering.I am a open-source enthusiast and I am passionate about learning new technologies and implementing them. I am an avid reader and love exploring stuff beyond their limit. I love dancing though I am not good at it XD. An interesting feature about me is that I just can't stop myself from over-eating pasta. I am excited to meet people and share their ideas with a cup of coffee :)
